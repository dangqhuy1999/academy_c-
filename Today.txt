```C++
You inherited a piece of code that 
performs username validation for 
your company's website. 
The existing function works reasonably well, 
but it throws an exception when 
the username is too short. 
Upon review, 
you realize that 
nobody ever defined the exception

The inherited code is provided for you 
in the locked section of your editor.
Complete the code so that, 
when an exception is thrown, 
it prints `Too short: n` 
(Where n is the length of the given username)

Input Format:

The first line contains an integer, t, 
the number of test cases. 
Each of the t subsequent lines 
describes a test case as a single username string , u.

Constraints:

1 <= t <= 1000
1 <= |u| <= 100
```

```algorithm
Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. 
A reviewer rates the two challenges, 
awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for
three categories: 
problem clarity, (tính rõ ràng của vấn đề)
orginality, (Tính độc đáo)
and difficulty.(Độ khó)
The rating for 
Alice's challenge is the triplet a = (a[0],a[1],a[2]),
and the rating for Bob's challenge is the triple b= (b[0],b[1],b[2])

The task is to calculate their comparison points by
comparing each category:
```

```sql
Query  the list of CITY names starting with vowels
(a,e,i, o or u) from STATION.
Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Query the two cities in STATION with
the shortest and longest CITY names, 
as well as their respective length
(i.e.: number of characters in the name).
If there is more than one smallest or largest city,
choose the one that 
comes first when 
ordered alphabetically 

Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Sample Input

For example, CITY has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY.

Sample Output

'''
ABC 3
PQRS 4
Explanation
'''

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with lengths  and . The longest name is PQRS, but there are  options for shortest named city. Choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

Note
You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query.

```data structure
Given a 6x6 2D array, arr, 
an hourglass is a subset of values with
indices falling in the following pattern: 

There are 16 hourglasses in 6x6 array.
The hourglass sum is the sum of the values in
an hourglass.
Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in arr.

arr = 

-9 -9 -9  1 1 1 
 0 -9  0  4 3 2
-9 -9 -9  1 2 3
 0  0  8  6 6 0
 0  0  0 -2 0 0
 0  0  1  2 4 0

The 16 hourglass sums are:

-63, -34, -9, 12, 
-10,   0, 28, 23, 
-27, -11, -2, 10, 
  9,  17, 25, 18

The highest hourglass sum is 28 from the hourglass 
beginning at row 1, column 2:

0 4 3
  1
8 6 6

```
